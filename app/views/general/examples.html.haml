      %p We provide four example datasets using our workflow.  These files were collected at QB3 Mass Spectrometry Facility at the University of California, Berkeley, using an Orbitrap XL.

      %p <br> <b> Example 1.  </b> <br> A model dataset.  A single O-GlcNAcylated protein (alpha crystallin, P02489) was chemoenzymatically labeled and tagged with a dibrominated tag (Figure 1).  The entire protein was digested and analyzed by full scan MS.

      %p <br> <b> Example 2. </b> <br> A model dataset.  A single O-GlcNAcylated protein (alpha crystallin, P02489) was chemoenzymatically labeled and tagged with a dibrominated tag (Figure 1).  The entire protein was digested and analyzed by tandem MS2. <br>

      %p <br> <b> Example 3. </b> <br> A complex dataset.  GalNAz-labeled Jurkat cells were tagged with a cleavable biotin probe, enriched, and digested with trypsin (Figure 2).  The probe was cleaved to yield a highly enriched pool of isotopically recoded glycopeptides.  The isotopically recoded glycopeptides were analyzed by full scan MS.

      %p <br> <b> Example 4. </b> <br> A complex dataset.  GalNAz-labeled Jurkat cells were tagged with a cleavable biotin probe, enriched, and digested with trypsin.  The probe was cleaved to yield a highly enriched pool of isotopically recoded glycopeptides.  The isotopically recoded glycopeptides were analyzed by full scan MS, and then using an inclusion list, tandem MS2/MS3 spectra were collected. <br>
