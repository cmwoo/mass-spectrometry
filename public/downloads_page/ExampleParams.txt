	comment = The minimum and maximum charge we will search for tagged molecules at.

	iScansPerBundle = 20
	comment = A single scan may not have enough information to identify a match, so we combine this many scans in to a bundle for search purposes.

	iBundlePhases = 2
	comment = This value must be an integer divisor of iScansPerBundle.  The edges of a bundle of scans might happen to alignment poorly.  This is the number of different bundle boundary alignemnts the data is tried at.

	iScansPerMessage = 1000
	comment = Searching for matches can take a few minutes, so to make sure the user knows what's going on we print a message to the console once every (this many) scans.

	comment = This is the maximum error in m/z values we will accept compared to their expected spacing.

	iBlurStep = 25
	comment = Determines the degree of accuracy used in some internal optimizations.  Lower is more accurate, higher is faster.  Usually not significant either way.

	comment = Note that delta masses are only checked for in cases where the LC-MS machine identified the charge of precursor. (background noise of different charge values can prevent this)

	fMaximumPrecursorMZ_Error = 1.0

	comment = This is the minimum mass fraction of the MS2 data that must correspond to potential tag masses in order for it to be counted.  The fraction is doubled for delta tag masses, due to the less exact calculations involved.

	fMS1_MatchMaxScoreEffect = 60.0
	comment = No matter how high the score given to the corresponding MS1 pattern match is, the MS2 scan never gets more than this many points from the pattern match alone.

	fMS2_TagFound = 20
	comment = This is how many points an MS2 scans score is awarded if a tag mass is found within it.

	comment = This is how many points an MS2 scans score is awarded if a delta mass is found within it.

	comment = This is the minimum number of points an MS2 scan must be awarded for it to pass the filters.
